                When you read The Little Prince, were you surprised to find out that it was narrated by an adult? We were! To be
                completely honest, the book’s wonderful illustrations had grabbed our attention, and we were mildly
                disappointed that an adult narrator had wandered into its pages.
            </p>
            <p id="about-para-2">
                We shouldn’t have worried, though, because even though the narrator is a grown up, he’s a child at
                heart. And though he tells the story, the star of this tale is the little prince.
